# ðŸ“§ Spam Classifier

A simple machine learning project that classifies text messages as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)** using Python and Scikit-learn.

This project is part of my learning journey into machine learning and NLP. It uses a dataset of SMS messages to train a basic Naive Bayes classifier.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Classifies SMS messages into "spam" or "ham"
- Text preprocessing using `CountVectorizer`
- Model training using `MultinomialNB` (Naive Bayes)
- Simple accuracy evaluation

---

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter / PyCharm (for development)

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset used is a CSV file containing two main columns:
- `label` - indicates if a message is spam or ham
- `message` - the SMS text content

The dataset was cleaned to remove unnecessary columns like `v1`, `v2`, etc.
